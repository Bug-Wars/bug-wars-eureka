# Set SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE to stage as a HEROKU CONFIG VARIABLE
# Heroku will then use the profile below.
# The HEROKU CONFIG VARIABLE named EUREKA_USER_PASSWORD will replace
# eureka.user.password defined below.  This is how you hide passwords
# from Git.

# WARMING! Remember, once you commit something in Git, it's remembered...
# even if you overwrite it.  Advanced Git commands are needed to erase it
# from history, which runs the risk of data loss! DON'T COMMIT PASSWORDS!
